# Social Media Engagement Analyzer

Welcome to the Social Media Engagement Analyzer! This project helps you understand how different types of social media posts—like carousels, reels, and static images—perform in terms of likes, shares, and comments. By analyzing this data, you can gain insights into which post formats engage your audience the most.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, understanding what content resonates with your audience is crucial. This project uses **Langflow**, a user-friendly AI tool, and **DataStax Astra DB**, a cloud-based database service, to analyze social media engagement data. By examining metrics like likes, shares, and comments across different post types, we can derive actionable insights to enhance content strategy.

## Features

- **Data Storage**: Store social media engagement data in Astra DB.
- **Data Analysis**: Calculate average engagement metrics for various post types.
- **Insights Generation**: Use AI to generate easy-to-understand insights based on the data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.7 or later**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python)
- **DataStax Astra DB Account**: [Sign up for free](https://astra.datastax.com/)
- **Langflow**: [Install Langflow](https://docs.datastax.com/en/langflow/quickstart.html)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-engagement-analyzer.git
   cd social-media-engagement-analyzer
   

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. **Set Up Astra DB**:

   - **Create a Database**: Log in to your Astra DB account and create a new database.
   - **Obtain Credentials**: Download the secure connect bundle and note your database credentials.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

   env
   ASTRA_DB_SECURE_BUNDLE_PATH=path_to_secure_connect_bundle.zip
   ASTRA_DB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   ASTRA_DB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   

5. **Load Sample Data**:

   Use the provided `sample_data.csv` to load initial data into your Astra DB. You can use tools like [Astra DB's Data Loader](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/data-loader.html) for this purpose.

## Usage

1. **Start Langflow**:

   bash
   langflow
   

   Access the Langflow interface at `http://localhost:8501`.

2. **Create a New Flow**:

   - In Langflow, create a new flow and select "Blank Flow".
   - Add components to accept user input for post types.
   - Connect to Astra DB using the credentials from your `.env` file.
   - Set up queries to calculate average engagement metrics.
   - Integrate the OpenAI component to generate insights based on the data.

3. **Run the Analysis**:

   - Input a post type (e.g., "reels") into the Langflow interface.
   - Execute the flow to retrieve average engagement metrics.
   - View the generated insights, such as "Reels have twice as many comments compared to static images."
